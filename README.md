# Android_FragmentExample
Best example for creating using app for both mobile &amp; tablet devices

You can think of a fragment as a modular section of an activity, which has its own lifecycle, receives its own input events, and which you can add or remove while the activity is running (sort of like a "sub activity" that you can reuse in different activities). This lesson shows how to extend the Fragment class using the Support Library so your app remains compatible with devices running system versions as low as Android 1.6.

Before you begin this lesson, you must set up your Android project to use the Support Library. If you have not used the Support Library before, set up your project to use the v4 library by following the Support Library Setup document. However, you can also include the app bar in your activities by instead using the v7 appcompat library, which is compatible with Android 2.1 (API level 7) and also includes the Fragment APIs.
